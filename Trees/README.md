## Getting Started

CSC201 - Data Structures and Algorithms
Technical University of Crete.

April, 2023

The current project contains java implementations of the kd-Tree and the PR-QuadTree. The purpose of this exercise is to
develop the insertion and searching algorithms of the above mentioned and determine their search multiplicities by performing
random searches on them. 

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.
